      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to go back to blogging after more than a year of leaving it alone &amp;mdash; a PhD process is quite demanding, and I&amp;rsquo;m a father now â€¦ I always thought it was a pity that I stopped writing but here I am, trying to find some time to write again.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to apologize to readers I&amp;rsquo;ve not responded to, because of more pressing deadlines or stuff like that.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a great platform to deploy a blog with. Unfortunately and unlike Jekyll, I found it not very handy to setup a multilingual blog with. It has support for multilingual blog, but I think it is kind of hard to follow the guide.
So I decided to simply use git and git branches to build my blog with. And it works really well. If you are interested in building a multilingual blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages, please follow along.</description>

      <description>I quit Jekyll today. Not a really huge decision to make, the blog is really small at this point. I could convert all metadata and all by hand. That was before I knew that Hugo has some tools to ease the switch.
So long Jekyll I got tired of Jekyll for two reasons. The first is that I had a lot of stuff to install before being able to serve and test my website.</description>

      <description>Following the advice of Andy Hunt, I decided to start a blog. I want to be able to communicate my ideas in the most limpid way. Being a non-native English speaker, it is crucial for me to get used to write in English.
Goal I am currently learning population genomics, applied to microbial communities. Me and my supervisors are studying a biased gene conversion process in bacteria, using a natural transformation model of recombination : Acinetobacter.</description>
