<p>Functional programming is a style of programming which place the emphasis on
functions. Functions helps to clearly express the intent of a piece of code. To
me, <code>R</code> is a functional language. Its deep roots goes back to Scheme, a
functional LISP dialect. The imperative part of <code>R</code> are to be found in its <code>S</code>
legacy. In this post, I want to describe how I use functions in R, mixing
imperative and purely functional programming.</p>

<p>I will take as an example an analysis I&rsquo;ve done in the past few months. It was a
quick one day long analysis, but I think it would have been much longer if I had
not used
R<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6a5bf84d7e413edf98f3db000dff6cf1:Actually-it-is-t"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6a5bf84d7e413edf98f3db000dff6cf1:Actually-it-is-t">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I work in biology. In november, we received results of a run of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing">Sanger sequencing</a>. It was
done in 96 well plates on 800bp PCR amplicons. We quickly found out that some
sequences showed traces of contamination : we had secondary peak specifically on
our divergence markers. We had reasons to believe that sequences with secondary
peak would be distributed randomly over the 96 well plate if it was not a sign
of contamination. I decided to test the random distribution using a quick
simulation.</p>

<p>The simulation would do the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>generate 96 well plates with as much contaminated well as there were in our
plates.</li>
<li>generate a lot of those plates.</li>
<li>per well, count the average number of contaminated well, and average this
count over the plate.</li>
<li>compare this simulated statistic with the observed one in our plate.</li>
</ul>

<p>We first need to load some packages.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">library(assertthat)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
</code></pre>

<h1 id="functions-express-intent:6a5bf84d7e413edf98f3db000dff6cf1">Functions express intent</h1>

<p>We want a simple function to sample a number at random between 1 and n.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">random_well &lt;- function(n) sample(1:n, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This function does only one simple thing. But it has a name that clearly express
what it does and abstracts the sampling process, so simple as it is.</p>

<p>We also want a simple function to generate an empty plate, <em>ie</em> a plate where no
well is contaminated. A 96 well plate can easily be represented as a 8 by 12
matrix.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">initiate_plate &lt;- function() matrix(rep(0, 96), nrow = 8, ncol = 12)
</code></pre>

<p>In the same manner, the function is really simple, but now I can just call
<code>initiate_plate</code> and be done with it : I now have an 8 by 12 matrix with 0 all
over, ready to be filled up with simulated contaminations !</p>

<h1 id="recursion-shortens-the-distance-from-mind-to-code:6a5bf84d7e413edf98f3db000dff6cf1">Recursion shortens the distance from mind to code</h1>

<p>We now want to contaminate <em>n</em> well inside of this empty plate.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">plate_generate &lt;- function(plate = initiate_plate(), n) {
    assert_that(is.numeric(n), n &lt; 96)

    ## this function contaminate a plate well if it is not already contaminated.
    ## it uses recursion to do so.
    contaminer &lt;- function(mat) {
        x &lt;- random_well(8) # sample one line at random
        y &lt;- random_well(12) # sample one column at random

        if (mat[x, y] != 1) {
            mat[x, y] &lt;- 1
            mat
        } else {
            contaminer(mat)
        }
    }

    ## if the plate already have *n* contaminated wells, return it.
    ## otherwise create a plate with *n - 1* contaminated wells.
    ## this kind of recursion is particularly useful to think about.
    if (sum(plate &lt; n)) {
        ## if the plate does not have n wells contaminated
        contaminer(plate_generate(plate, n - 1))
        ## generate another plate with *n - 1* contaminated wells,
        ## and contaminate another random well.
    } else {
        plate
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>plate_generator</code> uses recursion. It is a style of function calling that I
believe to be discouraged in R. But as my stack cannot exceed 96, I can use
recursion without worrying too much about overflowing the R stack.</p>

<p>I have enclosed a function inside of it, since I do not need it outside of this
context. This function, <code>contaminer</code>, set the well / matrix value to 1 at a
random coordinate if the well is not already at 1. If the well is already
contaminated (equals to 1), I call <code>contaminer</code> on the plate again : it will
pick another random well, and contaminate it. If the well is already
contaminated (equals to 1), I call <code>contaminer</code> on the plate again : it will
pick another random well, and contaminate it. If the well is already … I think
you begin to understand how recursion works.</p>

<p><code>plate_generator</code> uses contaminer to create a matrix with <em>n</em> contamination
inside, <em>ie n</em> wells with a 1 value and <em>96 - n</em> wells with a 0 value. It does
so by first checking if the total count of plate is equals to <em>n</em>. If not, we
can generate a plate with <em>n - 1</em> contamination, and add another contamination
with <code>contaminer</code>. How can we generate a plate with <em>n - 1</em> contamination ? It
would be great if we had a function that generate a plate with the desired
amount of contamination. Well, it appears we have. This function is called
<code>plate_generator</code>. If we call <code>plate_generator</code> with <em>n = n - 1</em>, it will
contaminate another well ; the plate sum is now equal to <em>n</em> and we can return
it. But generating a plate with <em>n - 1</em> contaminated well implies that we have a
plate with <em>n - 2</em> contaminated well and so on. <strong>This is recursion</strong>. I have one
function that does one thing and call itself to reach its goal.</p>

<p>The <code>plate_generator</code> function is useful in the sense that I did not have to
think about it really well. I <em>know</em> it is not optimised. I know that I can
shorten the time of execution by first excluding wells that are already
contaminated from the parameters space of <code>contaminer</code>, instead of picking
/ checking / contaminating a well randomly. The function would gain in speed.
But I can generate ten thousands plate on my computer in less than 2 minutes.
The function did not take that long to develop.</p>

<p>The previous code is maybe a little bit tedious to understand. Anyway, once it
is tested, I do not have to care about how it is done. I can just call the
function, I know it will always give the same result, even if the implementation
change. It is a level of abstraction that clearly helps to develop clean and
clever code by iterative steps. I am not afraid of breaking everything up : I
know my functions does one thing and does it well. <strong>It has no side-effects</strong>.
This function is pure : it does not modify anything outside its scope.</p>

<p>We then need to count, per well, the number of neighbouring contaminated well.
This function is kinda tricky to explain, and demands some kind of expertise
with typical biological plates. I had to hardcode many stuff, so I guess this is
not the cleaner way to do it. But at least is works.</p>
